# Flight-Delay-Analysis

Description:

Utilized Python to perform exploratory analysis on 5000 flight delay listings and gain insights on delays of flights.

Aggregated and visualized the data by using pandas, NumPy and Matplotlib to compile a report.

Created a dashboard with Power Bi to help identify the main cause of flight delays.
